It's essential you understand the differences between the old covenant of law and the new covenant of grace. Here's one of my favorite Scriptures:
"For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
---John 1:17 

The law was given through a servant...Grace and truth came through the Son. 

The law talks about what man ought to be...Grace reveals Who God is. 

In the first miracle of Moses, he turned water into blood, resulting in death...In the first miracle of grace, Jesus turned water into wine, resulting in life and celebration. 

The letter (the law) kills...but the Spirit gives life (see 2 Cor. 3:6). 

Under the law, God demands righteousness from sinfully bankrupt man...under grace, God provides righteousness as a gift...your part is to receive it! EUANGELION!
